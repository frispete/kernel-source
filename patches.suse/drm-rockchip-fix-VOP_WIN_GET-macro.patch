Subject: drm/rockchip: fix VOP_WIN_GET macro
References: bsc#1175411

Git-commit: cc8f12996e24b102a086a253055ecc58c437c31d
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1

Commit 9a61c54b9bff ("drm/rockchip: vop: group vop registers") seems to
have unintentionally changed the defintion of this macro.  Since it is
unused, this was not spotted but any attempt to use it results in
compilation errors.

Revert to the previous definition.
