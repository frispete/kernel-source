Subject: [PATCH] kernel/cpu_pm: Fix uninitted local in cpu_pm

References: git fixes (kernel/pm)
Patch-mainline: v5.8
Git-commit: b5945214b76a1f22929481724ffd448000ede914

cpu_pm_notify() is basically a wrapper of notifier_call_chain().
notifier_call_chain() doesn't initialize *nr_calls to 0 before it
starts incrementing it--presumably it's up to the callers to do this.

Unfortunately the callers of cpu_pm_notify() don't init *nr_calls.
This potentially means you could get too many or two few calls to
CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED or CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER_FAILED depending on the
luck of the stack.

Let's fix this.
